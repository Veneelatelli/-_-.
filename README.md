#  This repository contains a machine learning project for predicting sales based on various features such as advertising budget, market size, and product category. The goal is to develop a predictive model that can accurately forecast sales and provide insights for business decisions.

Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting sales for a given dataset using machine learning algorithms. By analyzing different features such as advertisement spending and product category, the model attempts to predict the sales figures for different time periods or regions.

Objectives:
To predict sales using supervised learning techniques.
To identify key factors affecting sales.
To evaluate model performance using various metrics like RMSE and RÂ².
Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains the following features:

Date: The date of the record.
Store: Store identifier.
Product: Product identifier.
Advertising: The budget spent on advertisements.
Region: Region where sales took place.
Sales: The target variable representing the total sales.


Requirements
This project uses the following libraries:

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns



Model Development
The model development process involves:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset.
Data preprocessing: handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
Model selection: different algorithms were tested, including:
Linear Regression
Random Forest
XGBoost
Hyperparameter tuning using grid search and cross-validation.
